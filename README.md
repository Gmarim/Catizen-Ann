Catizen AI is a Play to Airdrop project combining Metaverse, Game Fi and Ai. The Catizen Ai team has partnered with Ton Fish to bring the Metaverse ecosystem to more users. The closed beta version recently ended and the game was canceled. More than 260,000 people have completed the beta and the full version of the game launches today.

Judging by the project roadmap (information will be below), airprop and placement of the token on crypto exchanges is planned for May of this year

This is a farm with free entry, where we get $CATS tokens (we can sell them in the future), you can donate to upgrade cats faster, you can invite friends. The game was launched by a Chinese team that boosted the $FISH token to 45 x. Now there is a large number of players, so the servers sometimes go down periodically, but this is normal at launch.

The game attracted very serious investors. Here's what the Catizen project says:

  <var>"We are pleased to announce the successful completion of Catizen's investment round, securing significant investment and broad support from respected partners including TON, Web3 Ventures, Mask Network, Y2Z, SecondLive, EMURGO Ventures, Moon Capital and Initiate Capital. Our mission at Catizen is to fundamentally transform GameFi industry using TON's dynamic ecosystem. Catizen is not only simple, but also fun: cats team up with identical siblings to create upgraded cats, ultimately earning AirDrop rewards Catizen Team"</var>

<b>Conclusions about the game Catizen</b>
	
As you know, in crypto you have to fly in at the start, so let‚Äôs play, get tokens and follow the news. The project has big plans to develop its ecosystem. They promise airdrops, token listing and other goodies. A notcoin-type game, also made on the TON blockchain, but without constant tapping on the screen, there is an interesting plot. The game just launched and in the first day more than 350,000 players connected, an excellent indicator and marketing.
